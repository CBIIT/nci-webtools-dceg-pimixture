        <h2><span >Introduction</span></h2>

        <p >The webtool, PIMixture estimates the absolute risk of
            asymptomatic disease or disease precursors. Because asymptomatic disease/disease
            precursors are often discovered through screening, collected data may present
            challenges for absolute and relative risk estimation. First, the time of
            disease onset for an individual is unobserved and falls between screening
            visits (interval-censoring). Second, there may be prevalent disease present at
            the initial screening visit. Third, prevalent disease is not always
            immediately diagnosed (e.g. in those with negative or equivocal screening
            results), and thus some disease found at later screening visits are missed prevalent
            disease. (See Figure 1 for an example of such data.)</p>

        <p >Typically, disease prevalence (a person's likelihood of
            currently having a disease) and disease incidence (a person's likelihood of
            acquiring future disease) are analyzed separately, but this is not always
            possible because it is not always known whether detected disease is prevalent
            or incident. PIMixture approaches this problem by simultaneously analyzing
            prevalent and incident disease. In PIMixture, logistic regression is used to
            model disease prevalence and proportional hazards models are used for disease
            incidence subject to interval-censoring; model parameters are then jointly
            estimated to account for disease where it is uncertain whether it is prevalent
            or incident.</p>

        <p >The PIMixture web tool provides multiple options for
            defining the baseline hazard of the proportional hazard model -- a fully
            parametric model that assumes a Weibull baseline hazard; a weakly-parametric
            model that uses integrated B-splines to model the baseline hazard; and a semi-parametric
            model. Both the weakly-parametric model and the semiparametric model also
            supports stratified random sample.</p>

        <p >Both absolute risk as a function of time (beginning with the
            initial screen) and relative risk, when covariates are included in the model,
            are estimated. Relative risks are presented as odds ratios for prevalent
            disease and hazards ratios for incident disease.</p>

        <p >The PIMixture webtool is based on R-package PIMixture (Cheung
            et al., 2017; Hyun et al., 2017). A thorough study on application of PIMixture
            models to electronic health records data as compared to existing methods has
            been done by Landy et al. 2018.</p>

        <h2><span >Models</span></h2>

        <p >PIMixture employs logistic regression models for prevalence
            and proportional hazards models for incidence and allows including multiple
            predictors or no predictor. For example, we consider a logistic regression
            model and a proportional hazards model including one predictor, <span><img src="images/image002.png" alt="x"></span>.</p>

        <p >Logistic regression model:<span><img src="images/image003.png" alt="equation 1"></span></p>

        <p >where <span><img src="images/image005.png" alt="p"></span>=probability of disease presence at
            baseline and 0&lt;<span><img src="images/image005.png" alt="p"></span>&lt;1; <span><img src="images/image006.png" alt="beta 0"></span>is the intercept, <span><img src="images/image007.png" alt="e^beta1"></span> is the odds ratio for disease presence
            when x=0 to when x=1.</p>

        <p >Proportional hazards model: <span><img src="images/image008.png" alt="equation 2"></span></p>

        <p >where <span><img src="images/image009.png" alt="lambda0(t)"></span> is a baseline hazard function for
            disease occurrence; <span><img src="images/image010.png" alt="e^gama1"></span>is the hazards ratio for disease
            incidence when x=0 to when x=1; The baseline hazard function <span><img src="images/image009.png" alt="lambda0(t)"></span> is the instantaneous rate at which a
            disease occurs to a subject, given that the subject has been disease-free up to
            time t. </p>

        <p >For incidence estimation, we need to estimate <span><img src="images/image011.png" alt="gama 1"></span>as well as <span><img src="images/image009.png" alt="lambda0(t)"></span> (or a cumulative baseline hazard
            function <span><img src="images/image012.png" alt="equation 3"></span>, and there are three options in
            PIMixture to estimate <span><img src="images/image009.png" alt="lambda0(t)"></span>, "parametric", "weakly-parametric" and
            "semiparametric" methods. Once we estimate <span><img src="images/image009.png" alt="lambda0(t)"></span> or <span><img src="images/image013.png" alt="equation"></span> and <span><img src="images/image011.png" alt="gama 1"></span>, we can estimate survival function, <span><img src="images/image014.png" alt="equation 4"></span>.</p>

        <p style="margin-left: 60px; text-indent: -25px">1. &nbsp; Parametric model: we assume the baseline hazard function is generated from a Weibull
            distribution, and accordingly, <span><img src="images/image015.png" alt="equation 5"></span><b>, </b>for <span><img src="images/image016.png" alt="t >= 0"></span> and <span><img src="images/image017.png" alt="alpha 1, alpha 2 > 0"></span>. Weibull distributions are determined
            by two parameters <span><img src="images/image018.png" alt="alpha 1"></span> and <span><img src="images/image019.png" alt="alpha 2"></span>. Hence, if the distribution assumption
            is correct, parametric models are the most efficient.</p>

        <p style="margin-left: 60px; text-indent: -25px">2. &nbsp; Weakly-parametric
            model: Like piecewise constant hazard functions, we approximate the cumulative
            hazard function <span><img src="images/image020.png" alt="equation 6"></span>, using integrated cubic B-splines <span><img src="images/image021.png" alt="B_k(t)"></span>'s and the piecewise intervals are
            determined by quantiles of observation times. The weakly-parametric method of
            PIMixture needs to estimate total 7 parameters <span><img src="images/image022.png" alt="alpha_k"></span>'s by default. </p>

        <p style="margin-left: 60px; text-indent: -25px">3. &nbsp; Semiparametric model: we assume <span><img src="images/image023.png" alt="equation 7"></span> is a step function with jumps at unique
            observation times at most. Hence as the number of unique observation times
            increases, the number of parameters for <span><img src="images/image023.png" alt="eqation 7"></span> increases. The iterative convex
            algorithm is employed to nonparametrically estimate <span><img src="images/image023.png" alt="equation 7"></span>.</p>

        <p style="margin-top: 20px">The assumptions are strong in the order of "Parametric" &gt;
            "Weakly-parametric" &gt; "Semiparametric", whereas if data satisfies the
            assumptions, variance of estimates is in the order of "Parametric" &lt;
            "Weakly-parametric" &lt; "Semiparametric". Computation burden increases
            according to the number of parameters to estimate.</p>

        <h2><span >Sampling Design</span></h2>

        <p >PIMixture provides two options for unweighted and weighted
            data. Specifically, unweighted data represents a simple random sample or an
            entire cohort; everyone of a simple random sample has an equal selection
            probability, so we don't have to add sampling weight. Weighted data in
            PIMixture represents a stratified random sample, of which selection probabilities
            vary across strata and are the same within a stratum, and the selection probabilities
            are known. For weighted data analysis, users additionally specify two variables
            for strata and sampling weights (&gt;=1). </p>

        <p >In PIMixture, it is optional to include predictors in

            given in terms of odd ratios for prevalent disease and hazard ratios for
            incident disease. There are two options for predictors, continuous or
            categorical variables. For example, let us consider a logistic and proportional
            hazards models for assessing the association between the probability of being
            osteoporosis and body mass index (BMI). BMI can be coded either continuous or
            categorical (1: BMI&le;18.5, 2: 18.5&lt;BMI&le;25, 3: 25&lt;BMI&le;30, 4: BMI&gt;30 or

        <p >Users should specify a reference level for categorical
            predictors. For example, when we set a reference level for BMI to be 2 (or
            "normal'), the logistic and proportional hazards models are</p>

        <p >where I(BMI=a)=1 if BMI=a; 0 otherwise. </p>

        <p >Please note that the number of parameters for continuous and
            categorical variables are 1 and the total levels-1 in logistic and proportional
            hazards models.</p>

        <h4>Interaction Effects</h4>
        <p>Let us consider two factors, sex (binary) and BMI (categorical) and interaction effects between two factors. Then the logistic and proportional hazards models are as following:

        <h2><span >Prediction</span></h2>

        <p >Based on the regression parameters and/or cumulative hazard
            function, we can predict prevalence and incidence using an independent data
            (called test data) including the predictors used for estimating the parameters
            and cumulative hazard function. For prediction, users need to upload fitted
            model, test data and input time points. When time point=0, predicted
            probabilities mean the prevalences of subgroups characterized by specific
            predictors; when time point=t&gt;0, predicted cumulative risk up to time t
            includes prevalence too. Test data should include the same variables used for
            fitting the model.</p>

        <h2><span >Tips for handling errors</span></h2>

        <ul>
            <li >The general coding rules described in Section 4.1 are one of
                primary screening filters. For checking if coding for the outcome variables is
                correct, users can try a simple model with no predictor. </li>

            <li >When models include too many predictors, it can cause convergence
                issue because the number of events in a subgroup may be too small.</li>

            <li>When models include interaction effects, it can cause convergence issue, particularly more often in parametric models.</li>

            <li>When you name categorical variables as covariate, please be cautious not to use any values of other categorical variables. This caution avoids generating weird labels for regression coefficients, odds ratio (OR) and hazards ratio (HR). For example, when a categorical variable name is "hpv_16" , and a categorical variable "hpv_type" has three levels, ("hpv_16", "hpv_18", "hpv_45"), then this makes weird labels.</li>
