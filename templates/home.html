    <h2>PIMixture</h2>
    <p>The webtool, PIMixture estimates the absolute risk of asymptomatic disease or disease precursors. Because asymptomatic disease/disease precursors are often discovered through screening, collected data may present challenges for absolute and relative risk estimation.  </p>
    <ul>
        <li>First, the time of disease onset for an individual is unobserved and falls between screening visits (interval-censoring).</li>
        <li>Second, there may be prevalent disease present at the initial screening visit.</li>
        <li>Third, prevalent disease is not always immediately diagnosed (e.g. in those with negative or equivocal screening results), and thus some disease found at later screening visits are missed prevalent disease.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The PIMixture web tool provides multiple options for defining the baseline hazard of the proportional hazards model -- a fully parametric model that assumes a Weibull baseline hazard; a weakly-parametric model that uses integrated B-splines to model the baseline hazard; and a semi-parametric model.  Both the weakly-parametric model and the semiparametric model also supports stratified random sample.  The detailed manual is placed at <a href="#help">Help page</a>.
